     <h1>L.UX Workshop 1: Reciprocated Learning</h1>

      <blockquote>“Who dares to teach must never cease to learn.” - John Cotton Dana</blockquote>

      <p>On the 2nd of February 2016 we ran our first workshop. A free Introduction to User Experience Design, led by Eliot.</p>

      <p>The workshop was, by our expectations, a roaring success: there was a high attendance rate (49 students of 52 RSVP’s), received great feedback and met some pretty awesome people along the way.</p>

      <p>As much as it was about us teaching, it was also a learning experience for ourselves. We’ve learnt more about how we work together as a team, about Wellington’s passionate UX community and what they hope to learn.</p>

      <p>Here's a few choice photos from the night</p>
