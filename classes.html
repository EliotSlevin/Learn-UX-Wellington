     <h1>Practical Wireframing - a Workshop for Beginners</h1>

      <p>A good interface is key to any successful digital product. A good interface must be usable, understandable, and fit for purpose. Your users must be able to pick it up and use it right away, and have a great time while using your product.</p>

      <p>Wireframing is a key step in the design process for any interface. In this 3h workshop you will design two interfaces from scratch. You can bring your own idea of what you want to design for one of the apps, or you can pick one from our hat of app ideas.</p>

      <h4>What you'll learn</h4>
      <p>What makes a good interface?</p>
      <p>What does the UX design process look like?</p>

      <p>User research methods</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focused brainstorming</li>
        <li>Ethnography</li>
        <li>Task analysis</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      <h4>What you’ll make</h4>
      <p>Lots and lots of wireframes! Over the course of the afternoon we’re going to run through a full design process for two user interfaces. The first interface will be a constructive task given by us, but the second interface can be for anything you like! If you have an idea for an app, web app, service, or any other type of software, this is a good opportunity to work on it while learning.</p>

      <h4>Who’s this class for</h4>

      <p>This class is designed for people working in the tech industry, and is focused on designing interfaces for software and websites. So if you work producing any sort of tech product, such as mobile / tablet apps, desktop software, web based software, this is the workshop for you.</p>
