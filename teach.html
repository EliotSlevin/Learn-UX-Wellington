    <h1>Share your Knowledge</h1>
  </div>

  <section>
    <p>Wellington is home to fantastic design talent, and a lot of industry experience. Knowledge like this is hard to acquire, very few people actually understand how design is applied and used in the tech industry.</p>

    <p>If you have this knowledge, we’d love to help you share it. We run workshops, lectures, classes, and would love you to help run one - even if you’ve never tried to teach design before.</p>

    <strong>What we provide</strong>

    <p>There’s a lot to running an event, and we realise that you are very busy. So we handle all the boring stuff - finding a space, organising a time, marketing to the right people, and make sure that people are interested and keen to attend.</p>

    <p>First we figure out what content you could teach, and who it would be aimed at. Would it be a free lecture for 50 people? Or a paid workshops for 10? It all depends on what content you want to teach.</p>

    <p>Then we promote the event, asking people to register their interest. Once we have enough people keen to come along, then we organise a time, space, and start marketing. Then you can start giving more thought about the content of the event. We do this because we know you’re busy - and nobody wants to write a whole lecture then realize nobody wants to hear it.</p>

    <p>Then the event runs! We handle all organising of tickets / attendees, and are there on the day to set up any equipment you might need, direct people into the room, and make sure it all goes smoothly.</p>

    <strong>If you have knowledge to share, we want to hear from you.</strong>

    <p>Please get in contact with Eliot Slevin at <a href="mailto:eliot.slevin@gmail.com">eliot.slevin@gmail.com</a>, or 021 026 31187</p>
